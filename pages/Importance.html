    <p> Trees produce oxygen, the main ingredient to sustain life. They give us a vast range of products that are beneficial for our lives.
        Trees give us fruits and flowers. They provide us wood for fuel. They also have great medicinal values. Trees play an important
        role in purifying the air around us. They ensure a pollution free environment.

        These days trees are cut down to meet various needs of man. As a result, the ecological balance is disturbed. Rapid urbanisation
        is one of the major causes of deforestation. To combat this threatening situation many private agencies along with the State 
        Government and Central Government have started to organise awareness campaigns.

        They encourage people in planting new trees. They even distribute saplings of fast growing trees. Eminent personalities from 
        various fields have come forward to support this noble initiative. Tree plantation is necessary to prevent Mother Earth from perishing.</p>
